      Please let us know your preference and we'll do our best to make it happen.

        We'll be providing dinners Thursday, Friday and Saturday free of charge.
        We plan to also do a large grocery trip to purchase breakfast and lunch
        items that guests can access throughout the weekend.

      <span>
        In order to provide these additional meals we're asking folks to contribute

        these additional meals.
