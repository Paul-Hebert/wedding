# Frequently asked questions

## Are children allowed?

Yes, bring your kiddos! Just be sure to keep an eye on them. We'll be in the woods, a road runs through the property, and the river can be fast-moving.

## Are dogs allowed?

Unfortunately dogs are not allowed at Trout Creek Wilderness lodge in order to protect the natural environment. We look forward to seeing your fuzzy friends another time.

## Is food provided for the weekend?

We'll be providing dinners Thursday, Friday and Saturday free of charge.
We plan to also do a large grocery trip to purchase breakfast and lunch
items that guests can access throughout the weekend.

In order to provide these additional meals we're asking folks to contribute
a small amount to help cover the costs. We're asking for a contribution
on a sliding scale of $0-$50 per person for these additional meals.

You can choose whether you'd like to opt in to these additional meals or not.

## What is the dress code?

We'll be in the woods for the weekend so dress casually and comfortably.

For the day of the ceremony we ask that you dress "wedding casual."
(Please dress nicely but it doesn't have to be too fancy.)

You'll be walking around on the forest floor so you may want to skip the heels.
Bring a swimsuit if you want to go swimming or hit the hot tub!

## What is the lodging like?

Check out our [lodging page](/lodging)! (You can request specific lodging when you [RSVP](/rsvp).)

## Is it going to be inside or outside?

We'll be outside pretty much the whole time! Please plan accordingly.

## Can I bring a Plus-One?

Thinking of bringing a Plus-One who's not on your invitation?
We'd love to meet your special someone, but hosting people is expensive.
Please only bring serious partners: no friends or flings.

## Where can I park?

There are a number of designated parking spaces on the property. We ask that you
carpool if possible. Check in with us when you arrive and we'll find you a spot
to park

## Do I need to wear a mask or socially distance?

We do not plan to mask or socially distance but please do whatever makes you feel
safe and comfortable!

## Anything else I should know?

Cell service may be limited. There's hiking and other activities on site.

Check out the [agenda](/agenda) and [lodging](/lodging) pages for more info!
